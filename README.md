ICD-10 Coding Assistant
Inference Analytics AI – Capstone Project

Overview:
This project develops an AI-powered assistant that predicts ICD-10 medical codes from short clinical text descriptions. The goal is to make the medical coding process faster, easier, and more consistent for healthcare professionals.

The system combines retrieval-based search and large language models (LLMs) to improve context understanding and code accuracy.

How It Works:

Data Collection: ICD-10 code descriptions and related medical text were gathered from public sources.

Knowledge Base: All ICD-10 code data is embedded using transformer models and stored in Milvus, a vector database that enables fast and efficient similarity search.

Model: A fine-tuned Qwen-based Large Language Model (LLM) uses the retrieved information to predict the most relevant ICD-10 codes.

RAG Pipeline: The system applies a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach:

Retrieve the most relevant ICD-10 entries from the vector database

Generate and refine predictions based on the retrieved context

Key Features:

Predicts ICD-10 codes from short clinical notes or diagnosis descriptions

Uses a knowledge-augmented retrieval system for context-aware predictions

Adaptable for clinical documentation or healthcare analytics tools

Modular design for easy integration and future fine-tuning

Tech Stack:

Python 3.10+

Sentence-Transformers for embeddings

Milvus for vector search and retrieval

Hugging Face Transformers for reranking and LLM integration

PyTorch, pandas, tqdm for data handling and processing

Setup:

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/SwayamDesai/icd10-coding-assistant.git
cd icd10-coding-assistant


2. Install Dependencies

pip install sentence-transformers transformers accelerate pandas tqdm torch pymilvus bitsandbytes


3. Run the Pipeline

python main.py


Purpose:
Medical coding is a crucial but time-intensive process. By combining retrieval-based search and large language models, this project demonstrates how AI can make coding workflows more efficient and consistent—ultimately supporting better healthcare data management and decision-making.
